Question 1:

Take clone of the repository and run "npm install" command and then run "npm start" command

Question 2:

Understand the Mobile Application: Begin by thoroughly understanding the existing mobile application. Identify its key features, functionality, user interface, and user experience. Evaluate the overall structure and flow of the application. This will help you gain a clear understanding of what needs to be implemented in the web app.

Design the Web App Architecture: Plan the overall architecture of the web app. Decide on the React components and their hierarchy, routing structure, and state management (e.g., Redux, React Context). Determine how data will be fetched from APIs or existing back-end systems.

Create Wireframes and UI/UX Design: Create wireframes or mockups for the web app to visualize the user interface and user experience. Design the web app's look and feel to align with the existing mobile app or any specific design guidelines provided. Iterate on the design until it meets the desired standards.

Set Up Development Environment: Set up the development environment for React. Install the necessary tools, such as Node.js, npm or Yarn, and a code editor. Initialize a new React project using create-react-app or a similar tool.

Implement Features: Start implementing the planned features of the web app one by one. Follow best practices for React development, such as breaking down the UI into reusable components, managing state effectively, and ensuring clean code organization. Implement necessary API integrations for data retrieval and updates.

Question 3:

I have worked with Next.js(SSG, SSR), Bootstrap(design), moment(for date-time), axios(for API call), Material-UI, Redux, Ant-Design, Formik(for form validations), lodash(for debouncing) and so on

Question 4:

 In intellect app, you can work with animations in better way and viewport can be of full width so that status bar can be submerge in photos
